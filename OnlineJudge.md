If you want to practice **ACM-ICPC-style competitive programming**, there are several excellent **online judges** that you can use. Here's a structured list based on difficulty, community, and features:

---

### **1. Classic ACM-ICPC Platforms**

These are directly associated with ICPC or are used by ICPC teams worldwide.

1. **[UVa Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/)**

   * Problems often used in past ICPC contests.
   * Over 4,000 problems with difficulty from beginner to advanced.
   * Minimalist interface, good for training algorithmic thinking.

2. **[ICPC Live Archive](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/)**

   * Official archive of past ICPC regional and world finals problems.
   * Contains historical contests with problem sets from actual competitions.

3. **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)**

   * Regular contests similar to ICPC in format (div2 for beginners, div1 for advanced).
   * Good for practicing time management and team-style problem solving.
   * Active discussion community for solution explanations.

---

### **2. Other Popular Online Judges**

Useful for general algorithm practice with a huge problem database.

1. **[AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)**

   * Japanese platform with regular beginner and advanced contests.
   * Good for dynamic programming, graph, and combinatorial problems.

2. **[SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge)](https://www.spoj.com/)**

   * Thousands of problems, many classical algorithm challenges.
   * Minimalist judge, used by many ICPC teams for training.

3. **[Timus Online Judge](https://acm.timus.ru/)**

   * Russian-origin judge used by ICPC contestants.
   * Good collection of beginner to mid-level problems.

4. **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms)**

   * Beginner-friendly.
   * Structured domains for specific algorithms (graphs, DP, strings).

5. **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)**

   * While more industry-oriented, it’s great for practicing algorithms efficiently.
   * Frequent “contest” mode simulates ICPC timed problems.

### **3. Team-Practice & Simulated Contests**

To train under ICPC rules (teams of 3, 5-hour contests):

1. **[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)**

   * Used in ICPC regional contests.
   * Allows creating custom contests for team practice.

2. **[Codeforces Gym](https://codeforces.com/gyms)**

   * Access past contests from ICPC-style competitions.
   * Simulate team contests offline.

3. **[CSAcademy](https://csacademy.com/)**

   * Regular contests and practice problems.
   * Good for timed practice similar to ICPC.

---

### **4. Strategy for Training**

* **Start with classic ICPC problems**: UVa, Timus, Kattis.
* **Solve by topic**: graphs, DP, math, strings.
* **Simulate contests**: 3-hour or 5-hour blocks, solve as a team if possible.
* **Analyze solutions**: Read editorials for learning new techniques.
